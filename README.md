## T9 Fullstack JS
<!-- TODO: -->
A number to word list converter as a Node backend and React/Redux fronted.

The backend provides a rest endpoint that converts a given numeric string into a list of corresponding words in the style of [T9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)) or [Phonewords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneword). For example, given the input 23 the output would be: `ad, ae, af, bd, be, bf, cd, ce, cf`

The frontend allows the user to enter a number, query the backend for the corresponding expansions, and display them.
